Q: Why I didn't use a criterial building?

A: For problems with the time, and beeing a small proyect I was thinking that didn't was necesary.

Q: Where theyare the test?

A: I know that the correct way to make the test is before start with the code but in this case, for the same problem with the time and beacuse I normally made unit test I was waiting till finish the proyect.
